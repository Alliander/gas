# gas
IEC-CIM inspired reference model for the Gas Utility grid

# goals
The purpose of this model is to facilitate information and data exchange concerning gas infrastructure between applications and organizations. The primary focus are the transmission and distribution grids in the gas domain.

# paradigms
- model is inspired by IEC-CIM and explicitly uses concepts/objects in CIM that are not specific to the Electricity domain.
- modelled in OWL for interoperability with adjacent information standards.

# quick start
The models have a persistent URL from at https://w3id.org/gas/. The can be opened in editing applications like Protégé (https://protege.stanford.edu/). They can also be called from within code (e.g. java or python) using respective OWL libraries
